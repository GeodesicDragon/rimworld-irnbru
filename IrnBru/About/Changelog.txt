Version 1.17.63 (November 20th 2020)

* Got loads of Bru? Running out of places to put it? Then you need the new Irn-Bru Keg!
	* Condenses 1,000 units of Bru into a single storage space.
	* Kegs can be bought and sold like normal Bru bottles, with a market value of 10,000 silver.
	* Bru in kegs does not deteriorate.
	* Preparing a keg requires 1,000 Bru and 100 steel.
	* Kegs can be filled and emptied at the brewery. Emptying a keg returns the 100 steel to you.
	* Kegs have a mass of 50kg.
	* Kegs have a maximum stack size of 5.
	* Scottish goods traders may have a keg for sale.
	* Remember to update your stockpiles!
	* Hilariously bad texture created by me, as per usual.
* The kilt now turns invisible when equipped, since I never could get it to look good on different body types.
* Slightly changed the texture of the deep-fried Mars bar.
* Increased silver carried by Scottish goods traders to a flat 20,000 silver (was between 7,500 and 10,000).

	* Cholesterol now takes longer to clear up.
	* Cholesterol now reduces blood pumping by 10/20/30% per level (was 5/10/15%).
	* Eating a deep-fried Mars bars now increases a pawn's cholesterol to 0.3 (was 0.15).
	* Pawns with high cholesterol now have a chance of having a heart attack every 7 days (was 30).
	* High cholesterol is now marked as life threatening; as a result, you will now be warned of a medical emergency whenever a pawn reaches an extreme level of build-up.
* Re-added the Scottish goods trader as a caravan merchant.
* Slightly increased how often the Scottish goods trader arrives.

AUTHOR'S NOTES

1. This change allows you to use utility items such as smokepop belts with a kilt equipped.
2. Kilt makers who lived hundreds of years ago didn't exactly have access to a tailoring bench powered by a geothermal generator, so I guess you could say that this change reflects history.
3. It was possible for pawns to practically live off deep-fried Mars bars; by the time they needed to eat again, the cholesterol would have cleared up, meaning there was no real danger. These changes increase the risks, and add a bit more realism to the mod; living on these things would kill you in the real world, so why should it be any different on the rimworlds? By all means, feel free to get in touch with me via my Discord server if you feel that these changes are too much, too unfair or just plain stupid.

Version 1.15.46 (August 20th 2020)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.2 patch.

Version 1.15.45 (June 2nd 2020)

* Kilts now increase the pain shock threshold of pawns by 10%.
* The Scottish goods trader is now orbital only.
	* Author's Note: I never saw it as a land caravan, but I saw it quite often as an orbital trader, so I made this change.
* Drastically increased the amount of silver and stock carried by the Scottish goods trader.

Version 1.15.42 (June 1st 2020)

* Added the kilt.
	* Made at tailoring benches using 100 fabric or leather.
	* +25% social impact.
	* Good at keeping the wearer cool.
	* Little to no protection from attack.
	* Base market value of 150 silver.
	* Covers waist and legs.
	* I've tried to make it fit pawns of all sizes as accurately as possible, but - given my appaling art skills - there may be times when it doesn't look right.
* Renamed 'deep-fried chocolate' to 'deep-fried Mars bar.'
	* Has the same stats as deep-fried chocolate, and does the same things.
	* Hilariously awful texture by me. (I tried to make it look somewhat like an actual Mars bar wrapper, though you can tell I failed miserably.)
	* Mars is a registered trademark of Mars Incorporated and is used without permission, though I will gladly comply with any request to remove the product name.
* Further reduced how often Scottish goods traders arrive.
* Increased steel cost of Irn-Bru recipe back to 25 (was 20). The berry cost remains the same.
* Increased market value of Irn-Bru to 15 (was 1.5).
	Author's Note: After running the numbers, I found that the old value of Irn-Bru meant that you were losing around 40 silver for every five bottles sold. This change should result in you making a profit - of around 28 silver per five bottles - from making and selling it. Increasing the steel cost means that there is little difference in profit between using steel or berries.
* Increased the amount of silver carried by Scottish goods traders.
* Slightly increased the amount of steel carried by Scottish Goods traders to account for the increased steel cost.
* Irn-Bru, deep-fried chocolate and haggis now appear in their own 'Scottish foods' sub-category under the main 'Foods' category.
	* This keeps them separate from other items, and makes them easier to find in stockpiles.
	* Thanks to alexbb721 from my Discord server for suggesting this change.
