	<description>Adds Irn-Bru, deep-fried Mars bars and haggis to RimWorld, as well as a trader who buys and sells them. Irn-Bru can also be stored in kegs to save space.\n\nAlso adds a kilt which, when worn, provides some protection against heat and increases a pawn's social impact by 25%, alongside a 10% increase in the pawn's pain shock threshold.\n\nIrn-Bru is a registered trademark of AG Barr plc and is used with permission.\n\nMars Bar is a registered trademark of Mars Incorporated and is used without permission, though I will gladly comply with any request to remove the product name.</description>
