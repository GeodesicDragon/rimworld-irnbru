<!--CHANGELOG

Version 1.1.9 (May 8th 2020)

* Added a new recipe: deep-fried chocolate.
	* Requires 10 chocolate to make 5 deep-fried chocolate.
	* Has the same nutritional value as a simple meal.
	* Has half the market value of regular chocolate.
	* Provides a +3 mood bonus for 6 hours when consumed.
	* Requires refrigeration or freezing; it will begin rotting a day after manufacture.
	* I know it's not exactly a Mars Bar, but chances are they would have refused me permission to use the product name. At the end of the day, however, it's still deep-fried chocolate.
	* I tried to give it a chance of causing a heart attack, but I couldn't get it to work; if you can help, please get in touch.
* Irn-Bru is no longer flammable.
* Irn-Bru now requires refrigeration or freezing; it will begin rotting in 3 days after manufacture.
* Increased mass to 0.5 (was 0.2). This is the same weight as a standard 500ml bottle.
* Reduced nutritional value to 5% (was 30% by mistake).
* Reduced recreation value to 5% (was 30% by mistake).
* Recipe now requires 20 steel, down from 25, but it will still produce 5 bottles.
* Reduced work amount to 10 (was 20).
* Animals should no longer consume your Bru, even if they're desperate for nutrition, and your colonists should now seek it out for a recreation bonus.
